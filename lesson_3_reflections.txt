When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When collaborating with others, when working on a public project in order to receive issue reports and feedback, and
	when accessing the repository away from your main computer may be necessary.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


	Conflicting or unrelated changes might be made within the same branch from different ends (GitHub or other computer).
	Commit history would get messy to avoid losing changes if two different modifications were made starting from the same commit.
